# ReArt
Hackathon Project
Project by Bytes4Future FullStack Development Coding Bootcamp

This project, created during a 24-hour hackathon, aims develop a solution to help an artist who uses recycled materials for their art creations. The artist currently struggles to sell their work quickly enough.

**Solution:**
ReArt is a website designed for the artist to showcase and sell their unique, eco-friendly artworks. Designed with Figma and built using Next.js, CSS, and MongoDB, ReArt offers the following features:
*Artist Portfolio*: Beautifully showcase the artist's creations with high-quality images and descriptions.
*Online Store*: Allow customers to conveniently purchase artwork directly from the website.
*Limited-Time Bundles*: Encourage sales with special offers that combine artworks at discounted prices.
*Loyalty Points*: Reward customers for their purchases. Points can be redeemed for discounts on future artwork within a year.
*Referral Program*: Earn additional points by inviting friends who make purchases on the platform.

**Technologies:**
*Frontend*: NextJS, CSS.
*Backend*: MongoDB.

**Disclaimer**
*This project was created within a limited timeframe during a hackathon. It may not represent a fully-fledged e-commerce platform and requires further development for complete functionality.*
